====== cystache ======

A Cython/Python implementation of the mustache templating language.


=== Building and installing ===

To build run:
    python setup.py build

To install on the system run:
    python setup.py install


=== Running the spec tests ===

There is a github project collecting implementation neutral tests at:
    https://github.com/mustache/spec

It has been included as a submodule, and can be retreived from a git
checkout by running:
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

To run the spec tests:
    python tests/run_spec_tests.py spec/specs/*.json

If you want to run the tests without installing cystache
just add the build directory to your PYTHONPATH, for example:
    PYTHONPATH=build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.6/ python tests/run_spec_tests.py spec/specs/*.json


=== Basic usage ===

>>> from cystache import Template
>>> template = Template("This is a {{complexity}} example.")
>>> template.render({'complexity':'simple'})
u'This is a simple example.'
>>>
